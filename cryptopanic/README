Pre-requisites:
1. Mozilla Firefox
2. Python Installation
3. Geckodriver(included in the zip file)

Instructions:
1. First make sure you have all the prerequisites.
2. To run the script, cd to the working directory and run
	$ python scrape.py
3. The script will automatically perform the scraping and output to the file output.csv 

Time taken to scrape depending on your internet connection will be around 15-20 mins. This is because the bot is visiting around 500 links to get the titles. 
Thanks, and enjoy!
